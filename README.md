# Web-Design-Challenge
I completed this project during my Data Analysis and Visualization Bootcamp at the University of Pennsylvania. The purpose of the assignment was to learn how to use HTML to implement front-end visualization on a website.  

To learn this, I created a visualization dashboard website using visualizations I completed from previous assignments in the class. These previous assignments were used to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distances from the equator.   

To do this, I utilized a simple Python library and the OpenWeatherMap API. I created scatterplots from there and used the plots for this web design challenge. In building this dashboard, I created individual pages for each plot and added navigation features allowing users to means by which we can navigate between them. These pages contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. I also created a landing page, an additional page where users can see a comparison of all of the plots, and a page that users can use to view the data used to build them.   

The project includes a total of 7 pages; 

A landing page containing: 

This page includes an explanation of the project with links to each visualization page. It also has a sidebar containing preview images of each plot, and clicking an image takes the user to that visualization. 

Four visualization pages, each with: 

A descriptive title and heading tag along with the plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.  

A "Comparisons" page that: 

This page contains all of the visualizations on the same page so they can be easily compared and uses a Bootstrap grid for the visualizations. 

A "Data" page that: 

Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.  

The data comes from exporting the .csv file as HTML or converting it to HTML. I used pandas as a tool to generate the HTML table from the pandas' data frame.
